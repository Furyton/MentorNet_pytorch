# MentorNet
pytorch version

well, I'm still working on it, nothing happens in this repo right now.

UPDATE:
- 8.2.2020: add mentornet_nn class, it works but I am not sure if it is correct.
- 8.3.2020: add MentorNet class for training MentorNet_nn with StudentNet, it can run successfully on cuda. Same, I am not sure if it is correct.
- 8.4.2020: add dataset, dataloader and data_generator. the origin tf version didn't use much 'tf' in this part, so I just copy that here.
- 8.7.2020: add MentorNet trainer class, HAVEN'T TESTED.
